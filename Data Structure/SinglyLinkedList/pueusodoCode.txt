Insert PseudoCode

1- If the index is less than zero or greater than the length, return false.
2- If the index is the same as the length, push a new node to the end of the list;
3- If the index is 0, unshift a new node to the start of the list.
4- Otherwise, using the get method, access the node at the index -1;
5- Set the next property on that node to be the new node.
6- Set the next property on the new node to be the previous next.
7- Increment the length;
8- Return true.


Remove PseudoCode

1- If the index is less than zero or greater than the length, return undefined;
2- If the index is the same as the length -1, pop.
3- If the index is 0, shift.
4- Otherwise, using the get method, access the node at the index -1.
5- Set the next property on the node to be the next of the next node.
6- Decrement the length.
7- Return the value of te node removed.

Reverse PseudoCode

1- Swap the head and tail.
2- Create a variable called next.
3- Create a variable called prev.
4- Create a variale called node and initialize it to the head property.
5- Loop through the list.
6- Set next to be the next property on whatever node is.
7- Set the next property on the node to be whatever prev is.
8- Set prev to be the value of the node variable.
9- Set the node variable to be the value of the next variable.
